# Welcome to over worked ogres!

This is the project that we built for the Slackoffs Hackathon 2023. 


## Product Description:

- Corporate overlords often struggle to keep the leash on their empployees. Even the most dedicated staff memeber has found ways to elude the watchful eyes of corporate. We designed a place to allow underlings to createe a profile, upload a photo, and describe their role in the machine.

## User Story:

- As a user, I want to be able to register and place myself under the watchful eye of my employer. Adding my name, photo, and company role validates that I am "human" and contributing to the larger whole.

## Technology Used:

- We utilized express to render our html pages from ejs templates
- Bootstrap was used to create forms and our saucy page design
- MongoDB was utilized to host our employee profiles
- Github was used to facilitate collaboration between devs located accross the country.
- CSS was the digital frosting applied to our application. 

## Challenging Code:
- As one would expect, the instructional team did not struggle at all with the creation of this full functioning application created in a matter of hours. However, balancing a productive workflow while maintaining constont harassment and belittling of our students was difficult but well within our ability...clearly.
